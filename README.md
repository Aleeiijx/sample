## üåê Project Overview
The **VOTE - Virtual Online Transparent Elections** is a **Java-based application** designed to facilitate democratic participation. Through this secure, user-friendly platform, voters can register, cast their votes, and participate in elections, while administrators manage the process efficiently.

This system adheres to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and the potential for future expansions.

## üìä OOP Principles Applied
The Voting System leverages the following OOP principles:

### 1. **Encapsulation**
   - Critical data like user credentials and election details (e.g., vote counts) are encapsulated within respective classes.
   - Access is controlled via getter and setter methods.

### 2. **Inheritance**
   - The `User` abstract class is a shared base for `Voter` and `Admin` classes, reducing code redundancy.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
   - Overridden methods like `login()` ensure tailored behavior for voters and admins.

### 4. **Abstraction**
   - Abstract classes and methods define shared properties and behaviors, leaving specific implementations to derived classes.

## üåé Integration with SDG 16
This project supports **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions** by promoting:

- **Inclusivity**: Allowing all eligible users to participate in elections.
- **Transparency**: Ensuring a fair and accountable electoral process.
- **Civic Engagement**: Empowering users to exercise their voting rights in a secure digital environment.

The system strengthens trust in democratic institutions and contributes to peaceful governance.
